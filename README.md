#### How we do It
To get this information, we used two API keys, The first one being "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/air_pollution?lat=". This one is used to measure the CO2 levels in the air. "https://api.openweathermap.org/geo/1.0/direct?q=" this one is used to grab and display information about the desired vacation destination.

Ultimately, this app is made to help those seek and find the safe and healthly life they deserve.
