      <p class="subtitle">Improving Vacation Experiences for Individuals with Chronic Respiratory Conditions
      In the region of the Americas in 2019, chronic respiratory diseases accounted for 534,242 deaths. At Catch My Breathe!, we aim to enhance the quality of vacation location searches for users who have pre-existing conditions that can worsen their experience by not knowing the air quality conditions of a specific location in advance.
      Catch My Breathe! provides individuals with respiratory conditions the opportunity to verify the air quality of their desired vacation area. Users can inquire about air quality information and conditions that can be affected by contaminants such as pollution, pollen, smoke, and more. This empowers users to make informed decisions and ensure their chosen destination meets their health requirements.
      To prevent users from missing out on their vacation experience, our application also offers recommendations of nearby cities with better, if not perfect, air quality conditions. This ensures that users can have a successful and safe vacation without compromising their health and well-being.</p>
