    <h2>In the region of the Americas in 2019, chronic respiratory diseases accounted for 534,242 deaths. By creating our application, we seek to improve the quality of time for vacation location searches from users who have pre-existing conditions that will worsen their experience by not knowing beforehand, the conditions of the air quality they will encounter in a specific location. Catch my Breathe! Provides the opportunity for individuals with these conditions to verify the area they desire to vacation. Users will be able to inquire information about air quality, conditions that can be affected by contaminants, such as pollution, pollen, smoke, etc. Also, to prevent missing out on their experience, the application will show recommendations of nearby cities that will have better, if not perfect conditions for the userâ€™s vacation to be successful and safe.</h2>
